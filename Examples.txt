Example 1:
Introduce number of packets: 5
Packet 1: 3001
Packet 2: 1000
Packet 3: 1000
Packet 4: 2001
Packet 5: 2001
Packet 6: 1000
In this example although the sum of the packets is less than the addition of the capacities of the 3 lorries:
sum= 10.003<12.000 ,there is no way to store all of them so the algorithm returns: Oracle was wrong.

Example 2:
Introduce number of packets: 5
Packet 1: 3001
Packet 2: 1000
Packet 3: 1000
Packet 4: 2001
Packet 5: 2001

Output: oracle was right: 1,2,3,2,3

Example 3:
Introduce number of packets: 4
Packet 1: 4000
Packet 2: 4000
Packet 3: 1000
Packet 4: 3000
Packet 5: 1
As the sum of all weights is bigger than lorries capacity: Output:  Oracle was wrong.
